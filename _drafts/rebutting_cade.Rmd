Brian Cade [published a scathing condemnation of current statistical practices in ecology.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/14-1639.1/full) It promises to be highly influential; I have seen it cited by reviewers already. I agree with a great many points Brian raised. I also disagree with one very central point. 

First let's deal with the common ground. Brian's assessment of how carelessly AIC~c~ based model averaging is being used by ecologists is spot on. There's a lot of sloppy reporting of results as well as egregiously misinformed conclusions. Perhaps the biggest issue with AIC~c~ approaches is that they require *thinking* to be used effectively. In my experience with teaching ecologists to analyze data, they are desperate to avoid thinking, and it's close cousin, judgement. They want a turn key analysis with a clear, unambiguous interpretation. Unfortunately that's not what AIC~c~ gives you.
