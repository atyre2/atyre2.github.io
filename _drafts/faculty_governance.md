(This is an interesting essay from an Administrator)[https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2014/07/29/essay-new-approach-shared-governance-higher-education]. I like the overall tone -- the perception of the problem is worse than the reality, but arresting the trend is essential. Actual concrete recommendations! 

(A list of articles from AAUP)[http://www.aaup.org/our-programs/shared-governance/resources-governance]

Our outgoing president of the Faculty Senate had 
this to say about faculty governance: 

> ... the faculty must control the academic program including what classes are taught, how they are taught, what the requirements are for degrees, and how students should be evaluated. The faculty should also have the final say on cases involving the hiring, promotion, retention and dismissal of other faculty members. And faculty should have a substantial voice in many administrative matters, at least to the extent they touch on academics and professional concerns.
