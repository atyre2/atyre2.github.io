This is the second paragraph. Here's where the link to all the code is as a footnote.[^allthecode]

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# load necessary packages here
```

```{r}
curve(exp((1-x/100)), from = 0, to = 110)
abline(h=1)
abline(v=10)
curve(exp((1-x/100)*(x-5)/x), add = TRUE, from = 2, to = 110)
curve(exp((1-x/100)*(x-10)/x), add = TRUE, from = 2, to = 110)

curve(exp((1-x/100)), from = 0, to = 210)

```
