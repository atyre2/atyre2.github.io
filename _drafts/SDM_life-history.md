## What can species distribution models tell us about life history?

Waaayy back, waaay back. Back to my 1999 paper using virtual ecologists and individual 
based models I was interested in this question. I was intrigued therefore to see two 
new papers directly addressing this question with actual empirical data!

The first paper is Searcy and Shaffer (2016) am nat

The second paper is by [Marion Whittman and coauthors (2016)][Whittman-2016]
