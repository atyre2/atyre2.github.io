The [semester long course from Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/) uses `read.csv(..., sep="\t")` to read tab delimited files. I've been using `readr::read_tsv()` because ... well, just because! A student in my data management class (reasonably) had this question:

> Will both of these essentially do the same thing or are there considerations
> for using one vs. the other?

So that's a good question.[^allthecode]

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# load necessary packages here
```

[^allthecode]: All the code for this post, including that not shown, [can be found here](https://github.com/atyre2/atyre2.github.io/raw/master/_drafts/how-to-read-tab-delimited-files.Rmd).
