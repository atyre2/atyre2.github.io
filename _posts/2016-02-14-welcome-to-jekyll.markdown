So this is going to be the new home of all the material from [AMinPractice][AMinPractice].

I'm working on learning Git, Git Pages, Jekyll, Ruby, and ... I'm starting to loose track. 
The best part will be the ability to generate pages using R Markdown and have the code
and output appear seamlessly in the blog. Although right now I'm not sure how to pull that off. 
The way that Jekyll identifies code is different from Markdown, as far as I can tell. 

Oh well. More to learn!
