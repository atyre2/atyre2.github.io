TL;DR No. 

I'm going out on a bit of a limb here with that assertion. I don't have [The Gospel According to Caswell](https://books.google.com/books/about/Matrix_Population_Models.html?id=KZviQwAACAAJ&hl=en) close at hand to check. But I think the following argument is sufficient.[^allthecode]



This was stimulated by a question to my boss who passed it on to me. Here's the question:

> Can you sum sensitivities if they are on the same scale (e.g., survival rates)? 
> I know you canâ€™t sum fecundity and survival sensitive because they are on 
> different scales, but we were debating today whether you can sum or average
> sensitivities on stage transition rates.

## What's the sensitivity?

In the analysis of structured population models, the sensitivity of a matrix element is just the partial derivative of the population growth rate $$\lambda$$ with respect to that matrix element. So the question is, does this make any sense?

$$
\frac{\partial \lambda}
     {\partial a_{ij}}  +
\frac{\partial \lambda}
     {\partial a_{kl}}  = ?
$$

## The total differential

Think of what's behind this thing. The population growth rate is a function of the matrix elements, $$\lambda = f(a_{ij}, a_{kl})$$ and let's pretend for the moment that there are only two. The change in $$\lambda$$ caused by changing the inputs to the function can be approximated using the total differential

$$
\Delta \lambda \approx \frac{\partial \lambda}
                      {\partial a_{ij}} \Delta a_{ij} +
\frac{\partial \lambda}
     {\partial a_{kl}} \Delta a_{kl}
$$

which gets more accurate as the changes in the matrix elements get small. If 
$$\Delta a_{ij} = \Delta a_{kl} = 1$$, then this is just the sum of the sensitivities. So summing the sensitivities is the amount $$\lambda$$ changes if you change the matrix elements by 1 unit. But for survival that makes no sense biologically; survival is always less than 1. 

OK, choose $$\Delta a_{ij}$$ to be something smaller, like, a 1% change. Fine. Guess what? That's called the elasticity. Those CAN be summed up. 

## Conclusion

You can sum up the sensitivities, but the result is biologically meaningless. So don't.
