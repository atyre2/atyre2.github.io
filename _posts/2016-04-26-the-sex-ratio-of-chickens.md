I got the following email the other day

> Im trying to find the answer to a pretty simple question, but Im having a hard time finding a reputable source online, so I Googled "best ornithology schools" and you all popped up! Im wondering if the sex ratio for egg-laying chickens is about equal, 1 male chick : 1 female chick born.

Obviously a fan! I tried the same search and I must say we didn't exactly pop to the top.

I searched 'sex ratio chickens' and the first link 
was [Hays (1945)][hays1945]. From *The American Naturalist* no less, so a peer reviewed journal and a credible source. In the introduction he summarizes a range of previous sources with estimates varying from 48.77 \% males to 51.38 \% males. So approximately 50/50. In his own work (which is behind a paywall so not publicly available) he reports 49.7 \% males. His methods were

> In the ten-year period from 1935 to 1944 a total of 39 pure-
> bred Rhode Island Red females mated to pure-bred Rhode Island
> Red males qualified for study. Each female had a perfect record
> in fertility and hatchability and produced ten or more chicks
> during March and April

This is 1945, so statistics are largely absent. He does suggest that the standard error of the difference between yearly sex ratios and 50 \% is 1.42. I think that's just treating each year as a single observation. But the data are given. 


| Year| # of Dams| # of Male Chicks| # of Female Chicks| Sex not determined|
|----:|---------:|----------------:|------------------:|------------------:|
| 1944|         8|               70|                 78|                  9|
| 1943|         4|               43|                 45|                  9|
| 1942|         0|               NA|                 NA|                 NA|

| 1940|         6|               92|                 85|                  5|
| 1939|         5|               50|                 48|                 10|
| 1938|         3|               29|                 28|                  3|
| 1937|         2|               22|                 22|                  4|
| 1936|         3|               21|                 34|                 14|
| 1935|         4|               54|                 51|                  4|

So treating each year as a normally distributed observation I get


{% highlight r %}
sexratio <- with(table1, 100 * Males / (Females + Males))
sd(sexratio - 50, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(9)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] 1.45542
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight r %}
t.test(sexratio - 50)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## 
## 	One Sample t-test
## 
## data:  sexratio - 50
## t = -0.63463, df = 8, p-value = 0.5434
## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -4.279855  2.432553
## sample estimates:
##  mean of x 
## -0.9236509
{% endhighlight %}

So I get a slightly different standard error, but either way it isn't significantly different from 50 %. However this is ignoring a huge amount of information in this data.
For example, one thing that's cool is the variation between years.

{% endhighlight %}

So same conclusion as before. The intercept is not significantly different from 0, which is what we expect for 50/50 sex ratio. In addition, there's no evidence of significant variation between years. The estimated random effect variance is zero. 

Hays also has a table of data for 11 hens with complete records of sex of chick. The sex ratio there extends from 22 % up to 65 %! So repeating the same thing




{% highlight r %}
ind.model <- glmer(cbind(Males,Females)~1 + (1|Hen), data = table2, family=binomial)
summary(ind.model)
{% endhighlight %}

{% endhighlight %}

Again, the intercept is not significantly different from zero, so across the entire population the average sex ratio is not different from 50/50. However here we do see a non-zero variance between hens. Individual hens may have sex ratios that deviate from 50/50. It's a bit hard to interpret that standard deviation because it is on a log-odds scale. 

Imagine you are ordering chicks 'straight run', which means without sexing. This is the cheapest way to get chicks because the expertise to sex chicks at a young age is expensive. You want 4 hens, so you decide to order 8 chicks. With a 50/50 sex ratio you'll get 4 hens, right? 

Wrong! You can get any number of hens between 0 and 8! 4 is just the most likely outcome. In fact, nearly 4 out of 10 orders you'll get less than 4 hens. Of course, you could also do better; in 4 out of 10 orders you'll get more than 4 hens. The probabilities of each outcome are


{% highlight r %}
binomial_probs = data.frame(hens=0:8,
                            d = dbinom(0:8, 8, 0.5),
                            p = pbinom(0:8, 8, 0.5))

knitr::kable(binomial_probs, digits = 2)
{% endhighlight %}



| hens|    d|    p|
|----:|----:|----:|
|    0| 0.00| 0.00|
|    1| 0.03| 0.04|
|    2| 0.11| 0.14|
|    3| 0.22| 0.36|
|    4| 0.27| 0.64|
|    5| 0.22| 0.86|
|    6| 0.11| 0.96|
|    7| 0.03| 1.00|
|    8| 0.00| 1.00|

However, that assumes that there is no variation among hens, which we know is false. I can simulate data from the fitted model to see if this variation makes a difference to the probability of getting less than 4 hens.


{% highlight r %}
hens <- 1000
clutchsize <- 8
clutches <- matrix(NA, nrow = hens, ncol = 2)
mean_p <- ind.model@beta
var_p <- as.numeric(vcov(ind.model)) # uncertainty in p
var_ind <- ind.model@theta^2
logodds <- rnorm(hens, mean = mean_p, sd = sqrt(var_p + var_ind))
# convert to probability
p <-  1 / (1 + exp(-logodds))
males <- rbinom(hens, size = clutchsize, p = p)

library(ggplot2)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}

{% highlight r %}
binomial_probs$freq <- binomial_probs$d * hens
gg <- ggplot(as.data.frame(males),aes(x=males)) + geom_bar() + geom_line(data=binomial_probs, mapping=aes(x=hens, y=freq))
gg
{% endhighlight %}

So by including the between hen variation we end up with 34 % of orders having more than 4 females. This is about the same as without the between individual variation. However, there is a greater chance of getting 1 or 0 hens (7 or 8 males) in the order.

Not sure what the takehome is here. Randomness is two faced?
